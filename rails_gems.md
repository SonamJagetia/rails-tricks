## Gems that make Rails tick:

**ActiveSupport**: compatibility library, includes methods that change words
from single to plural, or CamelCase to snake_case. Better time/date support than
Ruby standard library.

**ActiveModel**: hooks features into your models.

**ActiveRecord**: Object-Relational Mapper (ORM), maps Ruby objects to your SQL
database.  Makes working with data way easier.

**ActionPack**: does the routing.  Maps incoming URL to controllers and actions.
Passes instance variables between controllers and views.  Can use different
templates like erb or haml.

**ActionMailer**: used to send out email, has text-based templates and not
regular web-page templates.
