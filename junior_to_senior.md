## Junior to Senior Developer

I decided to do some research on what qualifies someone as an entry level/junior
developer vs. senior.  Hoping to do some interviews with top Rails developers in
the Boston area to gain insight.  For now, I will document the process here.

### Entry Level/Junior Traits

*  Just out of school/bootcamp  
*  Assigned least complex coding tasks  
*  Make naive choices just to get code done/working  
*  Unaware of the bigger picture/design requirements  
*  Poor debugging skills/prematurely ask for help  
*  Know about 10% of what they think they know  

**What should their focus be?** (personal opinion/hypothesis)
*  Developing good relationships with co-workers/seniors so they have many
    places to go for help.  
*  Extreme humility.  Ask lots of questions.  Extreme desire to know WHY not
    just HOW/WHAT  
*  Reading lots of books/learning their stack inside and out  
*  Learning quirks of their language  
*  Start learning and using OO principles  


### Advanced Junior/Intermediate Developer Traits

*  2 - 10 years experience (generally, not always)  
*  Produce working code with less supervision  
*  Generally more focused areas of an app instead of high level design decisions
    or complicated tasks  
*  Good at maintenance tasks  
*  Decent at debugging. Sometimes get stuck on something for long time though.  
*  Have been through the whole dev cycle at least once and starting to recognize
    patterns to avoid.  
*  Take requirements at face value and don't push back when there might be a
    problem.  I.E. lack design confidence.  
*  Work horses of code.  Produce 80-90% of the code however only 10% of that is
    the more difficult stuff which is where Senior time is usually spent.  

**What should their focus be?** (personal opinion/hypothesis)
*  Mastering OO principles  
*  Re-building simple versions of the tools they use.  I.E. gems/frameworks  
*  Start thinking about business requirements more  
*  Reading through Senior's code whenever possible  
*  Practice communication skills with juniors.  Get good at figuring out where
    people are coming from  
*  Start getting depth in specific area or two of programming  
*  Start mastering a second language, don't just play with it  
*  Develop better problem solving/debugging skills.  Start recognizing patterns
    more  

### Senior Developer Traits

*  Better at project management/estimating and planning  
*  Able to communicate technical needs to a team and non tech stakeholders  
*  Self-sufficient/autonomous  
*  Experts in their stack/language.  Often experts in 2+ languages  
*  Amazing trouble shooters, know where to go to get answers quickly as possible  
*  Know which corners can be cut and which can't through experience and past
    rabbit holes  
*  Sought after for advice and gives talks at conferences frequently  
*  Good at getting knowledge about the business domain they support and not just
    code  
*  Seek out places with the most interesting problems  

**What should their focus be?** (personal opinion/hypothesis)
*  Mentoring intermediate developers  
*  Create a bridge between the tech and non tech people  
*  Master the business domain of their technology  
*  Continue learning new languages  
*  Find places with challenging/interesting problems
